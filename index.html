        <h2>CAMPAIGN MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>Through the SUSTAIN campaign, we aim to shed light and show people that modern lifestyle are dangerous to the environment. We also want to raise awareness and help enact meaningful programs to help defend against biodiversity loss from humans. By trying to recooperate lost biodiversity, we will be able to survive on this planet much longer, and perhaps be able to reconnect with the natural world. This will be done by raising awareness of how to live a sustainable lifestyle while not asking people to give up most of their lifestlye choices.

        <h3>Use of eco-friendly devices/items</h3>
        <p>By implementing eco-friendly tools/materials, people will be able to still live in luxury while also taking small steps to helping the environment. Even simple things as reusuable bags and elimination of plastic bottles will help immensely.

        <h3>Habitat Protection</h3>
        <p>By preserving natural habitats, the earth can start healing from the damage caused by humans. On top of that, we wish to help integrate and meld natural habitats and human habitats so that one doesn’t negatively affect the other.

        <h3>Better farming practices</h3>

         <h3>Better transportation infastructure</h3>
         <p>By developing better transportation in cities, it will lead to less people feeling like they need to drive everywhere. Affordable/free ways to travel in and around cities without having to spew gas into the atmosphere seems like a win-win.

        <h3>Well-rounded and affordable dietary options</h3>
        <p>By promoting better farming/cultivation of foods, food options/ peoples diets will naturally start to become more healthy. We want to push the idea that eating healthy is the right thing to do, and that it still tastes ju st as good, if not better.

        <h3>Recycling in the U.S. Is Broken. How Do We Fix It?</h3>
        <p>Recycling in the U.S. is broken. In 1960, Americans generated 2.68 pounds of garbage per day; by 2017, it had grown to an average of 4.51 pounds. And while many Americans dutifully put items into their recycling bins, much of it does not actually end up being recycled.
