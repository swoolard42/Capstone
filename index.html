        <h2>CAMPAIGN MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>Through the SUSTAIN campaign, we aim to shed light and show people that modern lifestyle are dangerous to the environment. We also want to raise awareness and help enact meaningful programs to help defend against biodiversity loss from humans. By trying to recooperate lost biodiversity, we will be able to survive on this planet much longer, and perhaps be able to reconnect with the natural world. This will be done by raising awareness of how to live a sustainable lifestyle while not asking people to give up most of their lifestlye choices.

        <h3>Sustainable Lifestyles</h3>
        <p>Our #1 goal of this campaign is to promote, and hopefully develop sustainable lifestyles. This can be done through a plethora of ways, many of which are in the aforementioned goals.

        <h3>Use of eco-friendly devices/items</h3>
        <p>By implementing eco-friendly tools/materials, people will be able to still live in luxury while also taking small steps to helping the environment. Even simple things as reusuable bags and elimination of plastic bottles will help immensely.

        <h3>Habitat Protection</h3>
        <p>By preserving natural habitats, the earth can start healing from the damage caused by humans. On top of that, we wish to help integrate and meld natural habitats and human habitats so that one doesn’t negatively affect the other.

        <h3>Better farming practices</h3>
        <p>Implementing better farming practices can not only help animals/nature in and around farms, but also humans. Removing harmful pesticides and other chemcials can help create a more healthy and sustainable way to farm.

         <h3>Better transportation infastructure</h3>
         <p>By developing better transportation in cities, it will lead to less people feeling like they need to drive everywhere. Affordable/free ways to travel in and around cities without having to spew gas into the atmosphere seems like a win-win.

        <h3>Well-rounded and affordable diet</h3>
        <p>By promoting better farming/cultivation of foods, food options/ peoples diets will naturally start to become more healthy. We want to push the idea that eating healthy is the right thing to do, and that it still tastes ju st as good, if not better.

        <h3>Recycling in the U.S. Is Broken. How Do We Fix It?</h3>
        <p>Recycling in the U.S. is broken. In 1960, Americans generated 2.68 pounds of garbage per day; by 2017, it had grown to an average of 4.51 pounds. And while many Americans dutifully put items into their recycling bins, much of it does not actually end up being recycled.

        <h3>Car emissions are a major source of pollution</h3>
        <p>Cars and trucks emit twenty percent of all greenhouse gases emitted in the United States, which is the second largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.  It was the largest for decades. This puts vehicle emissions in the United States as one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world.

        <h3>What is sustainable fashion and why is it so important</h3>
        <p>Sustainable fashion is a way in which brands create clothing that not only reduces the impact on the environment but is also mindful of the people who work to produce the garments.
